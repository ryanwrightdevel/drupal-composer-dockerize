# Mount Folder
The purpose of this folder is to allow us to drop files are that will be accessible within the containers. This can be handy when we have .sql or .sh files we'd like to run in the container. 

This folder will get mounted inside the `Apache/Php` and `Mariadb` container at the `/data`.
